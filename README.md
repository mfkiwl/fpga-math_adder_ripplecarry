# Building Math Hardware
## Parameterized Adder

This article is a sequel to the inquiry [“How do Computers do Math?“](/category/inquiries/computer-math).  It shows implementations for the math operations introduced in Chapter 7.  The circuits are build from the ground up using combinational described in HDL Verilog.

We assume a working knowledge of the Verilog hardware description language.  To learn more about Verilog refer a book such as “FPGA Prototyping with Verilog Examples” by Chu or read through the slides “Intro to Verilog” by MIT.  An introduction to the Verilog environment can be found in “Getting Started with FPGA Programming“.
